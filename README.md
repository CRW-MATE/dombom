# dombom
my own cross platform web game using html5 canvas and vanilla JS from scratch.
each js file does a special function,
# jystic.js
is for the joystic/button hybrid with the position and size as variables so you can adjust
# coll.js
takes control of the canvas and handle physical events(collision,borders,hitboxes,...etc) and draws what is to be drawn
# saveData.js
its the object that require human intervention i.e. the player ,named Pp1,it has keys for his size,position and other stuff too.

if you can't tell by now i love variables every thing is changable not hardcoded so that i could work on making the application "Le Responsive as Motsh Az POsiblu"
